GKB - Geographical Knowledge Based Search

We are sure no one can compete Google, but we have tried to create something google does not have right now.
People, even after search for places on google, do not get to the exact location as quickly as they would like to. We students of University of Melbourne have created an application
which would describe a place automatically or with the help of crowdsourcing, making life easy for users to get to their desired place.
